Data logger with the Arduino Uno

The program collects data with a sensor, stores data in an array and communicates with PC over serial port, where data is saved to a file.
I programmed Arduino with C, and on the PC I used Python. To read the data I used a temperature and humidity sensor DHT22 and library: https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
